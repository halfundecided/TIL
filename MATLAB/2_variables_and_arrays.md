#### 2.1 Variables and Arrays
* The fundamental unit of data in any MATLAB program is the **array**. 
* Array: a collection of data values organized into rows and columns and known by a single name.
  * Vectors: an array with only one dimension
  * Matrices: an array with two or more dimensions 
* The **size** of an array is specified by the number of rows and the number of columns in the array, with the number of rows mentioned first. 
* **variable**: a region of memory containing an array, which is known by a user-specified name. 
  * `double`: scalars, arrays of 64-bit double-precision floating-point numbers. the principal numerical data type in MATLAB. real, imaginary, complex. 
    * `var = 10.5`
    * `var = 4i`
  * `char`: scalars or arrays of 16-bit values, a single character. string. 

  #### 2.2 Creating and Initializing Variables in MATLAB
  1. Initializing Variables in Assignment Statements
      1.  `var = expression`, `e = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]`
      2. Shortcut Expressions
