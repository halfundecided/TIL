## Quizzler: Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design pattern 

### To make status bar white
- info.plist: add key, View controller-based status bar --> boolean NO

### What is a property List (.plist)?
- .plist is short for Property List and it's a file that's automatically created with every Xcode project. 
- This file stores configuration information for the application at runtime (when the app is running). 
- The information is stored in a format called a Key-value pair.

### `import Foundation` vs. `import UIKit`
- `import Foundation`: The Foundation framework provides a base layer of functionality for apps and frameworks, including data storage and persistence, text processing, data and time calculations, sorting and filtering, and networking. 
- `import UIKit`: The UIKit framework provides the required infrastructure for your iOS or tvOS apps. It provides the window and view architecture for implementing your interface, the event handling infrastructure for delivering Multitouch and other types of of input to your app, and the main run loop needed to manage interactions among the user, the system, and your app.

### Difference between method and function
- if it is within a class, and associated with the class, it is a method of the class 
- if it's outside of a class, it's function.
