### Chapter 1: Introduction to MATLAB
-------
* MATLAB: a special-purpose computer program optimized to perform engineering and scientific calculations. 


#### 1.1 The Advantages of MATLAB
1. Ease of Use
2. Platform Independence
3. Predefined Functions 
4. Device-Independent Plotting
5. Graphical User Interface
6. MATLAB Compiler
7. Excellent symbolic computation (i.e. expressing and evaluating polynomials)

#### 1.2 Disadvantages of MATLAB
1. It is an interpreted language and, therefore, can execute more slowly than compiled languages.
2. Expensive.
3. Indexes arrays at 1 instead of 0!!!

#### 1.3 The MATLAB Environment
* The fundamental unit of data in any MATLAB program is the **array**.
